## MediaWiki, Parsoid, and MariaDB with Docker

This is an attempt to use Alpine 3.7 as the base image for Mediawiki 1.30 with PHP v7 (with FPM) and Nginx. There is another container for Parsoid (insert version here) that runs with NodeJS (insert version here). As the database backend (specified in `docker-compose.yml`), the database backend is MariaDB (insert version here).

### The Images



### Activity Changelog

**17 Apr 2018 (Tuesday)** Build initialization.

To install Docker:

```
# Download & install Docker
wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

# Adding $USER to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Run build for `Dockerfile-mwiki` Dockerfile, tag with `alpine-wiki`

```
docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile-mwiki -t alpine-mwiki .
```

This Docker image has user `www` with UID of `1000` to match the typical first user on host machine. This would make it easier for volume mounting (installing extension, configuring stuff, etc).

To run and inspect:

```
docker run --name alpine-wiki --rm -p 80:80 -p 9001:9001 -it alpine-mwiki
```

The port `80` is used by the `nginx`, while port `9001` is used for the `supervisord` web UI (password protected, see `configs/supervisord.conf`). The `-it` flag for interactive mode. Pass `-d` flag for daemon mode.

If there is a problem and need to access the container, run this:

```
docker exec -it alpine-wiki /bin/bash
```

Run this Docker image with volume `-v` flag, then mount that volume with `bindfs`. Why do this? Well, it is easier to place the `LocalSettings.php` and eventual configuration to add more extensions in the future. With `bindfs`, I can mount the root-limited directory at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` to `$(pwd)/data` while not royally messing up with the permission since `bindfs` is smart enough to mirror the changes.

Then proceed with MediaWiki web installation. At the end of the installation process, download `LocalSettings.php` and place it at `$(pwd)/data/LocalSettings.php`, then assign the readable permission.

```
# Install bindfs
sudo apt install bindfs

# Run the container, set to destroy after exit
docker run --name alpine-wiki -v wiki-data:/var/www/mediawiki --rm -p 80:80 -p 9001:9001 -it alpine-mwiki

# bind from volume to data directory
sudo bindfs /var/lib/docker/volumes/wiki-data/_data data

# Copy LocalSettings.php & set 775 permission
chmod 775 LocalSettings.php
```

This trick is possible because during the creation of this Docker image, the `UID` of user `www` is mapped to `1000`, which is the typical first user on my linux host.

**18 Apr 2018 (Wed)** Tweaking Mediawiki image.

First change: so instead of download the `*.tar.gz` archive, I decided to switch to Git. Current stable branch is `REL1_30`, which is specified in the `Dockerfile-mwiki`. Composer is needed for this to work.
